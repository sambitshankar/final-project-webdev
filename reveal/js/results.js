You inspire those around you! Keep doing the good work and you will be rewarded for your deeds. You have that cheer in your life. Carry on Padawan",

You are so far from the line, you can't even see the line, the line is a dot to you! Be careful though padawan, you won't always be young. Take your deserved time off and go make a sad friend smile. That's what this whole small life is all about. Not everything is about money.",

Is that blatant Narcissism, I can't say but remember padawan, you might be headed to the dark side if you don't mend your ways now. Remember to breathe and realize that you are a mere invisible dot in the vast universe! Time to appreciate life. I know you will - sooner or later",
